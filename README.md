## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd fruit-vegetable-classification
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Deploy Model**: Follow deployment instructions for real-time classification.

## Model Architecture
The project employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the following architecture:
- **Input Layer**: Accepts images of fixed size (e.g., 128x128x3).
- **Convolutional Layers**: Series of Conv2D and MaxPooling layers to extract spatial features.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Dense layers with dropout to prevent overfitting.
- **Output Layer**: Softmax activation for multi-class classification (36 classes).

### Data Augmentation
Data augmentation includes transformations such as rotation, zoom, and flip to improve model robustness.

### Training Configuration
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy
- **Metrics**: Accuracy
- **Epochs**: Typically 20-30, based on validation performance
- **Batch Size**: 32 (adjustable)
